    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world data rarely comes clean. In this project, I'll gather data from various sources , assess its quality and tidiness issues, then clean it. The dataset to be assessed and cleaned is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gathering Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data to be gathered will come from 3 sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the twitter_archive dataframe will be download from classroom page directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second which is image_predictions dataframe will be recovered from udacity cloud. I used request and response to gather the data. Point to note is that it is in form of tab separated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third dataframe was obtained using twitter API. I first downloaded the favorite_count, retweets_count, full_text and lang into a tweet_json.txt file before transferring it into a dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I accessed the data visually and programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually, I opened the dataframes one by one and checked for errors that I could find. I also used the sample method to open random rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmatically, I used various methods such as info, value_counts(), sort_values(), duplicated(), isnull(), notnull(), sum(), count(), list(), dtype, types() and describe().\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are issues which I discovered:\n",

    "The extra zeros(+0000) in timestamp column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert timestamp and date into DateTime datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rating_denominator should always be 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "+0000 in retweeted_status_timestamp column values.\n",
    "\n",
    "retweeted_status_timestamp should be a datetime object.\n",
    "\n",
    "None values in the following columns:name,doggo, floofer, pupper and puppo columns.\n",

    "Erroneous datatype for tweet_id in tweet_json dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tidiness Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Create one column for dog age stages because a dog cannot exist in different age stages at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separate the timestamp into 2 columns(date and time) for easy analysis of individual factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I ensures that I followed the define-code-test procedure.\n",
